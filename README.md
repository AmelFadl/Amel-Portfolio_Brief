# Project 2: Hypothesis-Driven Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (SQL-Based)
🏆 **First Place Award – Advanced SQL Analytics Project (October 2025)**

## Project Overview
This project presents the analytical outputs of a telecom customer churn study,
focused on identifying key churn drivers and validating 10 business hypotheses
using SQL-based data modeling and aggregation logic. A baseline churn rate of
approximately 26.5% was established using an integrated customer and service dataset.

The dataset is included for educational use. SQL schema definitions, analytical views,
and detailed query logic are intentionally excluded.

## Objectives
- Establish the baseline customer churn rate
- Evaluate 10 business hypotheses related to customer behavior and churn
- Compare churn rates across customer segments
- Derive actionable insights for retention and strategy

## Methodology
- Customer segmentation based on demographic, service, and behavioral attributes
- Churn rate comparison between control and target groups
- Hypothesis validation using aggregated metrics

## Business Hypotheses Evaluated
1. Older married customers living in highly populated cities, with no dependents and above-average service spend, are more likely to churn.
2. Payment method and number of subscribed telecom services do not significantly impact churn behavior.
3. Increased service usage and larger household size are associated with higher churn likelihood.
4. Elderly male customers tend to be less likely to churn.
5. Customers without internet services in smaller cities are less likely to churn.
6. Customers who churn due to dissatisfaction tend to avoid premium internet services.
7. Customers on short-term contracts with multiple paid service add-ons and living in high-population areas are more likely to churn.
8. Customers who submit referrals and have dependents are less likely to churn, regardless of gender.
9. City population has limited impact on churn among high-spending internet-only households.
10. Certain service usage ratios among older customers with larger families are associated with lower churn rates.

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates that customers on monthly contracts, heavy internet users,
and those expressing dissatisfaction are more likely to churn, while referrals and
long-term contracts are associated with reduced churn likelihood.

The analysis highlights key opportunities to reduce churn through longer-term contract
incentives, improved customer experience, and stronger referral programs, supporting
long-term customer loyalty.

## Tech Stack
- SQL (MySQL)

## Notes
- All results are aggregated and anonymized.
- Churn indicator values used in visual outputs: 1 = Churned, 0 = Not Churned.
